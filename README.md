# Materials Structure Matching and Novelty Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes the **pymatgen** library to process CIF (Crystallographic Information File) structures, extract chemical formulas, and compare them against existing materials in the **Materials Project** database. The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Matching structures** found in CIF files with those in the Materials Project database.
2. **Identifying novel structures** that do not exist in the database.
3. **Analyzing and reporting on the materials dataset** using advanced structure matching techniques.
4. **Calculating ratios of novel vs. known materials** for research insights.

## Files and Functionality

### 1. `results_param.py`
#### Purpose
This script processes a collection of CIF files, extracts their chemical compositions, and attempts to match them with known structures in the **Materials Project** database using **StructureMatcher**.

#### Key Features
- Reads up to **128 CIF files** from a specified folder.
- Uses **pymatgen** to parse CIF files and extract chemical formulas in **alphabetical order**.
- Connects to the **Materials Project API** using an API key to query structures.
- Utilizes **StructureMatcher** with specific comparison parameters:
  - **Lattice tolerance**: `ltol=0.2` (adjusts for minor deviations in lattice parameters).
  - **Site tolerance**: `stol=0.3` (allows for atomic position variations).
  - **Angle tolerance**: `5.0` degrees.
  - **Primitive cell comparison**, **scaling enabled**, and **order-disorder comparator**.
- Compares each local structure to **all retrieved structures** from Materials Project.
- Outputs **whether a match is found** or not for each CIF file.
- Provides an overview of extracted formulas for verification.

#### How to Use
Run the script in a Python environment:
```bash
python results_param.py
```
Ensure that the CIF folder path is correctly set before execution.

### 2. `results.py`
#### Purpose
This script is similar to `results_param.py` but is designed for quick verification by processing **only the first three CIF files**.

#### Key Features
- Processes **up to 3 CIF files** instead of 128.
- Extracts chemical formulas and queries the **Materials Project database**.
- Uses a **default** `StructureMatcher` configuration for comparison.
- Instead of comparing with all retrieved structures, it matches against the **first found structure**.
- Outputs matching results in a concise format.

#### How to Use
```bash
python results.py
```
Modify the CIF folder path inside the script before running.

---
### 3. `novel.py`
#### Purpose
This script determines the **novelty** of materials structures by checking whether they exist in the **Materials Project** database.

#### Key Features
- Processes **all CIF files** found in the given folder.
- Uses a **fine-tuned StructureMatcher** with the same tolerance values as `results_param.py`.
- Tracks whether a structure exists in the Materials Project or is novel.
- Classifies each CIF file into:
  - **Novel Structure** (not found in Materials Project).
  - **Existing Structure** (found in Materials Project and matched).
  - **Unknown** (query error or API limitation).
- Calculates and displays the **ratio of novel structures** in the dataset.

#### Output Format
The script prints:
```
Structure Status:
file1.cif: novel
file2.cif: exists in MP
file3.cif: could not be checked

Overall ratio of novel structures: 67% (10/15)
```

#### How to Use
```bash
python novel.py
```
Ensure that the CIF file directory is correctly configured.

---
### 4. `combined.py`
#### Purpose
This script integrates the functionalities of `results_param.py`, `results.py`, and `novel.py` into a single streamlined execution. It processes multiple CIF files, extracts their chemical compositions, queries the **Materials Project** database, and determines whether each structure is novel or already known.

#### Key Features
- Reads **CIF files** from multiple directories.
- Utilizes **pymatgen** to parse CIF files and extract chemical formulas.
- Queries **Materials Project API** to compare structures.
- Uses **StructureMatcher** to assess structural similarity with tolerance settings:
  - **Lattice tolerance**: `ltol=0.2`
  - **Site tolerance**: `stol=0.3`
  - **Angle tolerance**: `5.0` degrees
- Classifies structures as **novel, existing, or unknown**.
- Computes and displays the **novelty ratio**.
- Supports **parallel processing** for efficient CIF file reading and matching.

#### How to Use
Run the script in a Python environment:
```bash
python combined.py
```
Ensure that all necessary CIF folder paths are correctly set before execution.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install pymatgen
```

## API Key Requirement
To query the **Materials Project API**, you need to set up an API key:
1. Register at [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/).
2. Retrieve your **API Key** from your account settings.
3. Replace the placeholder `MATERIALS_PROJECT_API_KEY` in each script with your **actual key**.

## Expected Output
Depending on the script executed, the expected results include:
- The **number of CIF files processed**.
- Extracted **chemical formulas**.
- **Match results** for each structure against the Materials Project database.
- **Novelty assessment and ratio** calculations (for `novel.py` and `combined.py`).

## Notes
- Ensure the **CIF folder path** is correctly set in each script before execution.
- The **API key must be valid** for queries to work properly.
- **Adjust parameters** in `StructureMatcher` to fine-tune the comparison criteria.
- Some structures might be **similar but not identical**; StructureMatcher helps detect minor variations.
